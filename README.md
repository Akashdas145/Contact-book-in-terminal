The Contact Book application provides a simple and interactive terminal-based menu that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. The menu includes the following options:

1. Add Contact

Allows the user to add a new contact by entering the name, phone number, and email. The information is stored securely for future use.

2. View All Contacts

Displays a complete list of all saved contacts in a clean, readable format inside the terminal. This helps users review all stored information at once.

3. Search Contact

Enables the user to search for a specific contact by name or phone number. The program shows matching results instantly, making it easy to locate individual contacts.

4. Delete Contact

This option allows users to remove a contact permanently from the contact list. The system confirms the deletion to prevent accidental removal.

5. Exit

Closes the application safely. All changes made during the session are saved before exiting.
